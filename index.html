<!-- Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)-->

<!-- Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter 
     correctly after exhausting all guesses) -->

<!-- Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update) -->

<!-- Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. 
     Display these until the user either wins or loses.)-->

<!-- When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start 
     the game over again (without refreshing the page). -->

<!-- When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart
     the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins). -->
